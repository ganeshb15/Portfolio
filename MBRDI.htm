        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I worked at Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India from April 2021 to September 2023. During these two years, I gained extensive experience in electro-mechanical systems, embedded C, Simulink, and automotive mechanical features. While I cannot share confidential details due to company policies, I will provide relevant insights into my work, showcasing my competencies for potential roles or collaborations. In the following sections, I will outline the key features I contributed to, the toolchains we utilized, and the knowledge I acquired. Additionally, I will highlight the innovative, self-motivated tools I developed, and conclude with details about the team I worked with.</p>

    </div>
        <div id="feature" class="terminal-section">

        <h1>Feature</h1>
        <p>I primarily worked on three key features: actuators, Camtronic systems, and sensors. Below, I will provide a detailed overview of each.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="terminal-section">
                <h2>Actuators</h2>
        <p>We had motor-controlled actuators for several components, with seven different actuators requiring motor control. A straightforward example is the throttle valve, which regulates fuel flow into the throttle based on the position of the accelerator pedal. This system was electro-mechanically managed by a control algorithm using PWM-based motor control, with the logic designed in Simulink models.
        </p>
        <br>     
        One of my main responsibilities was to understand the existing PWM motor control logic for these actuators and develop new features as required, as well as fix any bugs. The motor control system utilized Stateflow diagrams to manage different state scenarios, including maintenance and fail-safe mechanisms. These systems, combined with control algorithms, ensured precise motor movement control.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        Without disclosing any confidential details, I can mention that fault detection, correction, and, in the worst cases, fail-safe positioning and recovery actions were part of the software development I contributed to. The Simulink models were complex, covering all car line features and actuator variability.

        <h3>Variable Turbine Geometry Assembly (VTGA) Overview</h3>

         <p>The <strong>Variable Turbine Geometry Assembly (VTGA) </strong>is a cutting-edge turbocharger technology designed to enhance engine performance by optimizing exhaust gas flow. By dynamically adjusting the turbine's inlet geometry, VTGA significantly improves efficiency, minimizes turbo lag, and ensures smoother power delivery across a wide range of engine speeds. This adaptability is crucial for achieving optimal performance in various driving conditions.</p>



        <p>VTGA systems are classified into two types: <strong>Low-Pressure VTGA (LPVTGA)</strong>, which excels in high-speed operations, and <strong>High-Pressure VTGA (HPVTGA)</strong>, which allows for rapid spool-up at lower speeds. These systems are controlled by actuators, typically electric motors, that adjust the turbine vanes in real-time based on signals from the engine control unit (ECU). At our company, we are actively developing the motor control software unit using Simulink, ensuring precise control of the turbine vanes for enhanced responsiveness and improved fuel efficiency.</p>

            <h1>Swirl Flap in Automotive Motor Control and PWM</h1>
        
        <h2>What is a Swirl Flap?</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>swirl flap</strong> is a device in the intake manifold of an engine that helps improve fuel-air mixing.
            By creating turbulence (or "swirl") in the air entering the engine, it enhances combustion efficiency and reduces emissions.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic Function of Swirl Flap</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Swirl flap:</strong> Adjusts airflow into the engine, controlling the turbulence or swirl.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Better air and fuel mixing leads to improved combustion, efficiency, and reduced emissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Found in the intake manifold of the engine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Motor Control of Swirl Flaps</h2>
        <p>The swirl flaps are controlled by a small <strong>DC motor</strong> or actuator, often managed by the <strong>ECU (Electronic Control Unit)</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Position Control:</strong> The ECU sends signals to adjust the flap position based on engine data.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Mechanism:</strong> Sensors provide feedback on the actual flap position to ensure accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Software detects motor failures or positioning errors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>PWM Control (Pulse Width Modulation)</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>PWM</strong> is used to control the motor by delivering power in pulses, adjusting the flap's position.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Duty Cycle:</strong> The “on” time versus “off” time in each pulse controls motor speed. Higher duty cycle = more power.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> PWM ensures smooth motor control with minimal energy loss.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Sensor Module Development</h2>
    <p>As part of the sensor system development, I worked on creating software logic for sensor calibration, fault detection, and fail-safe mechanisms to ensure reliable sensor performance in various automotive conditions. Key contributions include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fault Detection:</strong> Designed software logic to detect sensor faults such as electrical failures, stuck readings, and validity cross-checks with nearby sensors.</li>
        <li><strong>Calibration & Signal Processing:</strong> Developed algorithms to convert raw voltage values to calibrated sensor data. Included mathematical interpolation and signal conditioning filter design.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenario-Based Validation:</strong> Ensured sensor readings aligned with expected vehicle behavior, such as verifying engine temperature increases with higher vehicle speed. Detected inconsistencies for potential sensor malfunctions.</li>
        <li><strong>Fail-Safe Mechanisms:</strong> Implemented fallback calculations using nearby sensor data in case of sensor failure to maintain system safety and performance.</li>

<h2>Camtronic Valve Timing</h2>
     <p>
        <strong>Variable Valve Timing (VVT)</strong> in the context of <strong>Camtronic systems</strong> refers to a mechanism used in automotive engines to optimize performance and efficiency by varying the timing of valve opening and closing. Camtronic is a specific type of VVT technology utilized by <strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong>, allowing for both <strong>variable valve timing</strong> and <strong>valve lift control</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Personal Experience</h3>
    <p>
        As part of my work with Camtronic systems, I gained a deeper understanding of engine timing, <strong>stroics</strong>, and <strong>VVT injection</strong>. I explored variations in engine performance based on the number of cylinders and learned more about overall engine operation. My role involved software maintenance and development, focusing on implementing <strong>state machine design</strong> to manage condition-based switches within the system. This ensured smooth transitions between different valve timing and lift profiles, optimizing engine efficiency across various driving conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <strong>Mercedes Camtronic systems</strong>, this technology provides a finely-tuned balance between fuel economy and performance, depending on driving conditions, while contributing to smoother engine operation and compliance with stringent emission standards. If you're working with VVT and Camtronic modules for Mercedes, you're likely dealing with control algorithms and actuator commands to switch between the cam profiles.

    <div id="contentContainer">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <h3>1. Variable Valve Timing (VVT)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The primary goal of VVT is to optimize airflow into and out of the engine by adjusting the timing of the intake and exhaust valves. This leads to improved fuel efficiency, better power output, and reduced emissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Operation:</strong> In traditional engines, valve timing is fixed. However, in a VVT system, camshaft timing is adjusted dynamically based on engine speed, load, and other parameters, enabling the engine to adapt to different operating conditions like idle, acceleration, or cruising.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Camtronic System</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dual Cam Profiles:</strong> Camtronic systems feature two different cam profiles on the camshaft—one for low-load conditions and one for high-load conditions. The system can switch between these profiles based on driving conditions.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low-load profile:</strong> Engaged when the vehicle is cruising or idling, minimizing valve lift and reducing fuel injection, which improves fuel economy.</li>
                <li><strong>High-load profile:</strong> Activated when higher power is needed, such as during acceleration. It increases valve lift, allowing more air into the combustion chamber, thus boosting power.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Actuation:</strong> Camtronic systems employ an actuator to shift the camshaft between the two profiles, typically using <strong>electromechanical actuators</strong> that adjust the camshaft's position relative to the crankshaft.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fuel Efficiency:</strong> By reducing valve lift during low-load conditions, the engine consumes less fuel.</li>
        <li><strong>Power on Demand:</strong> The system can switch to the high-lift cam profile when more power is required, facilitating better airflow and increased power output.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower Emissions:</strong> Optimizing valve timing and lift enhances combustion efficiency, resulting in reduced exhaust emissions.</li>
    </ul>
