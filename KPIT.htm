           <h1>Fixed-Point Arithmetic</h1>
    <p>Fixed-point arithmetic is used in embedded systems to represent numbers with both integer and fractional parts, but without using floating-point operations. It uses integers with a fixed scaling factor.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Points:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Q Format:</strong> Numbers are represented as <code>Qm.n</code>, where <em>m</em> is the number of integer bits, and <em>n</em> is the number of fractional bits.</li>
        <li><strong>Precision and Range:</strong> More fractional bits increase precision, and more integer bits increase range.</li>
        <li><strong>Addition/Subtraction:</strong> Simple like integer math if numbers have the same scaling.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiplication:</strong> After multiplying two fixed-point numbers, the result needs to be shifted to the right by the scaling factor.</li>
        <li><strong>Division:</strong> The dividend is scaled up before dividing to maintain accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Overflow/Underflow:</strong> Special handling like saturation is used to manage exceeding the limits of the number format.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Fixed-point math is faster and uses less memory than floating-point, making it ideal for embedded systems like automotive ECUs.</p>

<h2>MC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage)</h2>

<p><strong>MC/DC Coverage</strong> is a software testing method used in safety-critical systems like automotive or aerospace software. It ensures that decisions in the code are tested in a way that each condition within the decision is independently evaluated.</p>

<h3>Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Decision Testing:</strong> Ensures every decision (e.g., an <code>if</code> statement) is tested for both true and false outcomes.</li>
  <li><strong>Condition Testing:</strong> Makes sure that each condition in a decision affects the outcome independently.</li>
  <li><strong>Test Coverage:</strong> Tests enough cases to show how each condition influences the decision, but not every combination is required.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
if (A && B)
{
    // Do something
}
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Test case 1: A = True, B = True (decision is True)</li>
  <li>Test case 2: A = False, B = True (changing A makes the decision False)</li>
  <li>Test case 3: A = True, B = False (changing B makes the decision False)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> MC/DC ensures each condition in a decision is tested for its impact, making it an efficient and thorough testing approach for critical systems.</p>

        <h2>Model Migration to AUTOSAR Specifications</h2>
        <p>This project involved migrating Simulink models to <strong>AUTOSAR compliance</strong>, ensuring that the models adhered to industry standards while maintaining functionality. Here's a breakdown of the key tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>First experience with modeling</strong>, specifically migrating models to <strong>AUTOSAR compliance</strong>.</li>
  <li>Required <strong>variable changes</strong> in the <strong>database</strong> and updates to the <strong>model flow</strong> in Simulink.</li>
  <li>Made changes to specific <strong>blocks</strong> and adjusted the <strong>mapping structure</strong>.</li>
  <li>Passed test cases to both original and migrated models to ensure <strong>functionality remained the same</strong>.</li>
  <li>Conducted <strong>analysis and debugging</strong> to address any issues post-migration.</li>
  <li>Ensured compliance by performing <strong>global MXAM checks</strong>.</li>
  <li>Used an <strong>in-house tool developed by Renault</strong> to manage the entire toolchain process.</li>

<h2>Tool Development and Automation Workflow</h2>
<p>I was tasked with creating an <strong>automation process</strong> for a <strong>new team</strong> that had no existing framework. I independently developed automation for the <strong>Polyspace tool</strong>, which involved handling variable ranges and generating reports. The reporting was automated using a combination of <strong>VBA</strong> for formatting the <code>.doc</code> reports and <strong>MATLAB</strong> for Polyspace integration, ensuring it functioned as a complete system.</p>

<p>Additionally, I automated the <strong>static code analysis</strong> part of the toolchain using <strong>QAC</strong>, which was handled through a <strong>Python script</strong>. All these tools were integrated into a <strong>custom GUI</strong> that streamlined the automation process.</p>

<p>My responsibilities included <strong>independently designing, developing, and testing</strong> the entire tool, as well as <strong>maintaining it</strong> and resolving any bugs that arose. This was my first project where I handled the development and release entirely from scratch. For my efforts, I was recognized with a <strong>High Flyer Award</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Innovation in Vehicle Prognostics and Road Profiling</h2>
  <p>Toward the later part of my time with the company, I joined the <strong>ECode team</strong>, a group focused on <strong>education, learning, and innovation</strong>. Here, I conducted <strong>lectures and lab sessions</strong> based on my experience with <strong>Simulink modeling</strong> and <strong>embedded coding</strong>. I also delivered <strong>automation tutorials</strong> on <strong>Python integration</strong>. Additionally, I developed and updated the team’s <strong>curriculum</strong>, incorporating my own knowledge and feedback from colleagues.</p>

<p>As part of the innovation initiatives within the team, I contributed to a <strong>vehicle prognosis and diagnostics project</strong>, which aimed to develop <strong>low-cost automotive solutions</strong> for <strong>vehicle safety and prediction</strong>. I played a key role in creating a <strong>CI/CD workflow</strong> and establishing a structured <strong>coding architecture</strong> to support the team's work.</p>

<p>One of the key features I worked on in this project was solving the <strong>road profile problem</strong>, where we successfully developed a <strong>prototype solution</strong>. This work culminated in a paper published at <strong>IEEE Xpleo</strong> titled "<strong>Trigger-Based Pothole Detection Using Smartphone and OBD-II</strong>."</p>

        <h1>My Experience and Learning Journey</h1>

        <p>At my first company, I gained valuable experience through a <strong>dedicated 2-month training program</strong> focused on <strong>Simulink</strong> and <strong>automotive systems</strong>. As part of this training, we designed and tested models, which gave me a strong foundation in <strong>Simulink modeling</strong>. Additionally, I worked on <strong>embedded C coding</strong> within an existing coding architecture, learning how it integrates into the broader system.</p>

        <p>I also developed a deep understanding of <strong>fixed-point processors</strong> and explored various <strong>design blocks</strong> used in automotive systems, such as <strong>hysteresis</strong>, <strong>filters</strong>, and <strong>interpolation functions</strong>. These were all new and fascinating concepts for me. In the testing domain, I learned about <strong>MC/DC coverage</strong> and how to write <strong>robust test cases</strong> to ensure code reliability.</p>

        <p>Another area of growth was writing code for <strong>floating-point adaptations</strong>, where I gained insight into <strong>arithmetic details</strong> like <strong>scaling factors</strong> for filters and other crucial considerations when writing fixed-point code. Additionally, as part of a <strong>research project</strong>, I learned how to initiate and structure <strong>self-motivated projects</strong>, which further honed my skills in innovation and problem-solving.</p>

        <p>Overall, during my more than <strong>two years</strong> at the company, I gained <strong>extensive learning</strong> and hands-on experience, making it a highly enriching first corporate experience.</p>

<h1>Team Acknowledgment</h1>

<p>As my first company, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects alongside many colleagues and seniors. Each team was composed of a diverse group of individuals, and I learned a great deal from everyone. While it would be challenging to detail each person's contributions, I will provide a brief overview of the teams I worked with.</p>
<p>I was part of two teams: <strong>RNTBCI</strong> and <strong>ECode</strong>. Each team was large in terms of personnel, but the individual projects within those teams were more focused and limited in scope. I appreciated the opportunity to learn, innovate, and build lasting friendships during my time there, which made the experience truly memorable. I am grateful for the collaborative environment and the support I received from my teammates.</p>

<p>In the <strong>RNTBCI project</strong>, I had the privilege of working with a team that included numerous <strong>seniors</strong>, <strong>management personnel</strong>, and <strong>team leads</strong>, along with my fellow colleagues. As this was my first company, the adjustment was smooth due to the welcoming and friendly nature of the team. Below are some individuals whom I worked under as either managers or team leads, where I was a valued member of their team.</p>

<p>As part of the <strong>ECode team</strong>, I had the honor of working under <strong>Prithvi Sekhar Pagala</strong>, who led several innovation and learning initiatives. I am especially grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with him, as we not only worked on various projects but also published a paper together during my time at the company. It was a rewarding experience working within his team.</p>

    <h3>Genesis</h3>
    <img src="img/KPIT/kpit-25.jpeg" alt="Description of the image" width="450">

<p>These individuals were among my first friends and colleagues in the corporate environment during a 3-month training and exam period as part of the <strong>Genesis batch</strong>. I trained and learned a great deal with them, and it was an invaluable experience. We continue to collaborate on innovation projects even as friends. One such collaboration with <strong>Shristi Kumari</strong>, <strong>Vaishnavi Patekar</strong>, and <strong>Subodh Khandelwal</strong> led to the publication of a paper later on.</p>
